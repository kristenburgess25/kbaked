    <p>
      As you have probably deduced by now, I love cookies. However, my love for baked goods extends far beyond cookies. 
      Scones, croissants, cakes, biscuits, bagels, bread, muffins, pies, pastries, sweet, savory - I love them all! 
      I have also recently started getting into gluten-free and keto baking, so look for more of that content soon!

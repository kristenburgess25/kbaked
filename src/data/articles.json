    "introduction": "This is the 'famous' $250 Neiman Marcus chocolate chip cookie recipe. I have yet to find another recipe that I love as much and that turns out so consistently amazing. I often make them without the grated chocoalte bar and nuts, and they are just as good! I think the blended oatmeal in these is what gives them such a great texture and flavor.",
    "recipe": {
      "ingredients": [
        "1 cup butter",
        "1 cup dark brown sugar, packed",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "2 eggs",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla",
        "2 ½ cups oatmeal",
        "2 cups flour",
        "½ teaspoon salt",
        "1 teaspoon baking soda",
        "1 teaspoon baking powder",
        "12 ounces chocolate chips",
        "1 4-ounce milk chocolate bar",
        "1 ½ cups chopped nuts"
        ],
      "instructions": [
        "1. Heat oven to 375 degrees.", 
        "2. Cream together butter and both sugars. Stir in eggs and vanilla.",
        "3.Finely grind oatmeal in a blender or food processor. Combine the oatmeal, flour, salt, baking powder and soda in a medium bowl, and slowly add it to the wet ingredients. Beat just until combined. Grate chocolate bar using a microplane grater and add it, along with chocolate chips and nuts to the batter. Mix just to combine.",
        "4. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls, 2 inches apart, on a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes."
